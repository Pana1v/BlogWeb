<p>At first, this term for me only means pushups, lifting dumbells, and gyms, But as I started to go deep into it. It is beyond my imagination. Let me explain, As I started I have gone through many problems like when I did wall push-ups there was severe pain in my chest which led me to use hot water for reducing pain. Then I started skipping which leads to severe pain in my foot as it got swollen, Then I started shoulder Exercises which restrict me to hold a fork properly.As I Started Stretching and mid-splits, my nerves were in so much pain that it changed my walking style because the pain was coming from booty to toe. But I hadn&#39;t given up. I kept falling again and again then I learned from my mistakes and maintain consistency, and I know good at many things. Let me clear this term also, Dieting doesn&#39;t mean starving. Food is a main source of energy. We shouldn&#39;t skip it. We should just make choices about what to eat. Avoid or minimize intake of things like sugar, oil, rice, packages food, and junk food. Concentrate more on green food, raw vegetables, and roasted items. Use chappatis instead of rice. Don&rsquo;t drink water after a meal. Take proper 7-8 hours of sleep. Keep yourself active and energized. Keep your mind calm. Meditate, Focus, and Push yourself to your limits not beyond limits. Try to love yourself and your body. Accept your body as it is and start to make changes. Don&rsquo;t give up. Try every day something new.Remember pain is far better than disease pain. Try to love exercise pain. Increase protein in your diet. Start to make muscles. All the best</p>
